        <p>Fluffy, sweet pancakes stuffed with gooey Nutella. These feel indulgent and so addictive. A real treat for both kids and adults.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups whole buttermilk</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>10 teaspoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as NutellaÂ®)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk together buttermilk and eggs and add to flour mixture. Fold and stir until just combined. Add 3 tablespoons melted butter and stir until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add some of the remaining butter to skillet.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, spoon about 3 tablespoons batter per pancake and spread into circles in the pan. Cook until edges start to set and some bubbles start to form around edges and in center of batter, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Gently dollop 1 teaspoon Nutella in center of batter (it's ok if it isn't a perfect round).</li>
            <li>Dollop and lightly spread about 1 1/2 tablespoons more batter over Nutella to cover completely. Continue cooking until bottom and sides of pancake are golden brown and some bubbles are starting to form where Nutella is covered, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip pancakes and continue cooking until second side is golden brown and sides appear matte and cooked through, 2 to 3 more minutes. Transfer to plates and serve immediately.</li>
            
        </ol>
